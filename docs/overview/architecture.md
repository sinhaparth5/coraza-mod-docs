# Architecture Deep Dive

## Request pipeline

Every request runs through a single `Handle` method, in strict order:

1. **Bot challenge gate** — non-trusted clients without a valid bypass cookie are redirected to the
   JS proof-of-work challenge (subject to global + per-service bot mode).
2. **IP blocklist check** — exact-match block rejects.
3. **Global rate limit** — per-IP token bucket.
4. **Per-service rate limit** — optional, after routing.
5. **Geo blocklist check** — country block by resolved client IP.
6. **Coraza WAF inspection** — full CRS + custom rules.
7. **Reverse-proxy** to the matched backend.

Every stage logs the outcome via a **non-blocking queue** (buffered channel drained by one worker
goroutine), so the hot path never waits on the database. Every response — blocked or proxied — gets
its `Server` header forced to `Coraza WAF Mod` and the standard security headers applied.

## Reverse proxy & multi-app routing

Coraza WAF Mod routes to as many backend apps ("services") as you need from a single front door.
Two match modes per service:

- **Host match** — virtual hosting by `Host` header (e.g. `api.example.com` → one backend,
  `blog.example.com` → another). The request path is passed through untouched.
- **Prefix match** — route by URL path prefix (e.g. `/api` → a backend), with **automatic prefix
  stripping** before proxying, exactly like nginx `proxy_pass http://backend/`. The original client
  path is restored before logging so the dashboard shows what the client really requested.

**Routing precedence:** all prefix matches are evaluated first (**longest prefix wins**), then host
matches — mirroring nginx `location` blocks beating `server_name` defaults.

Each service gets its **own pre-built reverse proxy** with sane timeouts (5s dial, 10s response
header) so a slow/dead backend cannot stall browser connection slots indefinitely. Services are
**database-backed and hot-reloaded**: adding, editing, or removing a service rebuilds the routing
registry instantly with **no restart**.

**Passive health tracking:** there is no background polling loop. A service is marked unhealthy when
a real proxied request fails and healthy again when one succeeds. The only active check is a single
one-shot reachability probe when a service is first added (to reject obviously-dead backends before
saving).

## State & storage

Everything lives in one SQLite file via the pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite` driver. WAL mode plus a
bounded connection pool lets readers run concurrently with the single serialized writer. Services,
rules, TLS state, sessions, rate-limit snapshots, and settings are all DB-backed. Uploaded TLS
private keys are the one exception — those live on disk at mode `0600`.

Request logging itself is **fire-and-forget**: every pipeline stage enqueues its outcome on a
buffered channel drained by a dedicated worker goroutine, so logging never blocks the request hot
path. Logs are retained for a configurable number of days and pruned by a
[separate one-shot command](/docs/configuration/log-retention).

## Hot reload

The WAF engine, bot challenger, rate-limit backend, IP blocklist, and service registry are all
swapped behind read/write mutexes, so dashboard changes apply with no restart.

## Bundled data

The GeoLite2-Country and DB-IP ASN Lite databases, the OWASP CRS, and the minified dashboard JS are
all `//go:embed`-ed into the binary — there is nothing external to fetch at runtime. Everything (the
SQLite driver, GeoIP, ASN) is pure Go, so binaries are built with `CGO_ENABLED=0` and run with no
shared-library dependencies.
