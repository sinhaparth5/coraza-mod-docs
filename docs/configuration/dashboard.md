# Using the Dashboard

The dashboard lives at `/admin` and is behind session-cookie login. Every change below applies
**live** — no restarts. Each page is HTMX-driven, so adding/removing a row swaps just that part of
the page. This section walks through **every feature and exactly how to use it**, including the
underlying HTTP routes (handy if you want to script against them).

:::info How "implement" works here
You don't edit files or restart anything to use a feature. Each dashboard form maps to a route that
writes the change to `waf.db` and then **hot-reloads** the relevant subsystem (registry, blocklist,
geo, WAF engine, rate limiter). The steps below are the implementation.

## Services (backend apps) — *what gets proxied*

**Page:** `/admin/services` · **Purpose:** define which backend each incoming request is routed to.

**Add a service:**

1. Go to **Services → Add**. The add form is a short wizard.
2. Fill in:
   - **Name** — a label for the service (e.g. `api`).
   - **Match type** — `host` (virtual hosting by `Host` header) or `prefix` (route by URL path
     prefix).
   - **Match value** — the host (`api.example.com`) or the prefix (`/api`).
   - **Backend** — the upstream URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
   - **(Optional) Rate limit** — requests/second (`rps`) and `burst` for this service alone. Leave
     `0` to inherit the global limiter only.
3. Click **Add**. Before saving, the server **validates** the backend URL and runs a **one-shot
   reachability probe** — if the backend is unreachable, the save is rejected with an inline error
   ("fix the backend or try again before adding"). This prevents adding dead upstreams.
4. On success the routing registry is rebuilt instantly and the new row appears.

<div style={{margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/docs_service.png"
    alt="Services page showing the Add Service wizard on the left and the configured services list on the right with host match, TLS, rate limit, and bot mode controls per row"
    style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '1px solid #e2e5ea'}}
  />
</div>

**Behavior to know:**

- **Prefix routing strips the prefix** before proxying (so `/api/users` → backend `/users`), like
  nginx `proxy_pass http://backend/`. The original path is restored for logging.
- **Longest prefix wins**, and all prefix matches are checked before host matches.
- **Per-service TLS requires a host-matched service.** Prefix services can't have their own
  certificate (there's no SNI host to key it on) — the TLS panel will say so.

**Edit / manage a service:** use the **Manage** controls on a row to set per-service TLS (below),
per-service **bot mode** (`POST /admin/services/bot/:id` with `bot_mode` = `inherit`/`always`/`off`),
and per-service **rate limit** (`POST /admin/services/ratelimit` with `service_id`, `rps`, `burst`).

**Delete a service:** the trash control issues `DELETE /admin/services/:id` and rebuilds the
registry.

**Routes:** `GET /services`, `POST /services` (add), `DELETE /services/:id`,
`POST /services/ratelimit`, `POST /services/bot/:id`, plus the TLS routes below.

## Blocks — IP rules & geo/country rules

There are two independent block lists, both enforced **early** in the pipeline and both hot-reloaded
on change. See [IP & Geo Blocking](/docs/security/blocking) for how they fit the pipeline.

### IP rules

**Page:** `/admin/ip-rules` · **Purpose:** manually allow or block a single IP or CIDR range.

1. Go to **IP Rules**.
2. Enter:
   - **IP / CIDR** — accepts a single IPv4/IPv6 address (`1.2.3.4`, `::1`) **or** a CIDR
     (`10.0.0.0/8`). Anything else is rejected with a format hint.
   - **Rule type** — `block` or `allow`.
   - **(Optional) App/scope** — leave empty for a global rule, or scope it to a named app.
3. Submit. The rule is written and the in-memory IP blocklist reloads immediately, so the next
   request from that IP is affected.
4. **Remove** a rule with the row's delete control (`DELETE /admin/ip-rules/:id`).

<div style={{margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/docs_ip_rules.png"
    alt="IP Rules page — Add IP Rule form on the left with IP/CIDR input, scope selector, and block/allow toggle; Active IP Rules list on the right with rules overview stats"
    style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '1px solid #e2e5ea'}}
  />
</div>

These manual rules are evaluated alongside the IPs pulled in automatically by
[threat-intel sync](/docs/security/threat-intel-webhooks).

**Routes:** `GET /ip-rules`, `POST /ip-rules` (`app_name`, `ip`, `rule_type`), `DELETE /ip-rules/:id`.

### Geo / country rules

**Page:** `/admin/geo-rules` · **Purpose:** block or allow whole countries.

1. Go to **Geo Rules**.
2. Enter a **2-letter ISO country code** (e.g. `RU`, `CN`, `US` — case-insensitive) and a rule type
   (`block`/`allow`), optionally scoped to an app.
3. Submit. The geo blocker reloads instantly. Country is determined from the
   [resolved real client IP](/docs/security/trusted-proxy) using the bundled GeoLite2 database, so it
   works correctly behind Cloudflare / a trusted proxy.
4. **Remove** with the row's delete control (`DELETE /admin/geo-rules/:id`).

<div style={{margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/docs_geo_block.png"
    alt="Geo Rules page — Add Geo Rule form with country code input and block/allow selector; Active Geo Rules list showing a CN block rule with global scope and rules overview stats"
    style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '1px solid #e2e5ea'}}
  />
</div>

**Routes:** `GET /geo-rules`, `POST /geo-rules` (`app_name`, `country_code`, `rule_type`),
`DELETE /geo-rules/:id`.

:::note WAF rule blocks (related)
The **WAF Rules** page (`/admin/waf-rules`) lists CRS rules and lets you **disable** a noisy rule by
ID with a reason (`POST /admin/waf-rules/disable` with `rule_id`, `reason`) and re-enable it
(`DELETE /admin/waf-rules/:id`). The WAF engine rebuilds itself from the current disabled-rule list,
so the change is live. See [WAF Inspection](/docs/security/waf).
:::

## Certificates & per-service TLS

There are two related surfaces: a reusable **certificate pool**, and **per-service TLS** assignment.
For the full TLS picture see [TLS Setup](/docs/configuration/tls).

### Certificate pool

**Page:** `/admin/certificates` · **Purpose:** store named cert/key pairs you can reuse across
services.

1. Go to **Certificates → Add**.
2. Enter:
   - **Name** — a label (e.g. `wildcard-example-com`).
   - **Certificate (PEM)** — paste the full certificate chain.
   - **Private key (PEM)** — paste the matching key.
3. Submit. The certificate is parsed/validated; the **private key is written to disk at mode
   `0600`** (never stored in the database), and the cert appears in the pool with its expiry.
4. **Delete** a cert with its delete control (`DELETE /admin/certificates/:id`).

**Routes:** `GET /certificates`, `POST /certificates` (`name`, `cert_pem`, `key_pem`),
`DELETE /certificates/:id`.

### Assigning TLS to a service

Open a **host-matched** service's **Manage → TLS** panel. You have these options (all require a
host-matched service — prefix services are rejected):

- **Upload a custom cert** — paste `cert_pem` + `key_pem` for this service only
  (`POST /admin/services/tls/upload`). Stored on disk under `certs/services/<name>/`.
- **Assign a pool certificate** — pick one of your saved certificates
  (`POST /admin/services/tls/pool` with `cert_id`).
- **Enable auto-issue (ACME)** — Let's Encrypt provisions a cert for the service's host on first
  request (`POST /admin/services/tls/auto`). **Requires an ACME email to be set first** (see
  Settings, below); without it the action does nothing.
- **Clear TLS** — remove per-service TLS and fall back to the global cert
  (`POST /admin/services/tls/clear`).

At handshake time certificates resolve by SNI: **per-service custom → per-service/pool/legacy
autocert → global fallback.**

## Request logs

**Page:** `/admin/logs` · **Purpose:** see, filter, export, and live-tail every request decision.

**Live tail.** With **no filters set, on page 1**, new rows stream in over Server-Sent Events
(`/admin/logs/stream`) — you watch traffic in real time. Applying any filter switches to paged
history queried directly from SQLite (so you can page deep without the stream interfering). You can
force history mode with `?mode=history`.

<div style={{margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/docs_logs.png"
    alt="Live Logs page showing the live stream active indicator, date/app/status filters, and the request log table with time, app, IP, method, path, status, and duration columns"
    style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '1px solid #e2e5ea'}}
  />
</div>

**Filtering.** Use the filter controls; they map to query parameters on `GET /admin/logs`:

| Filter | Param | Example |
|---|---|---|
| App / service | `app` | `api` |
| Status class | `status` | `2xx`, `4xx`, `5xx` |
| From (datetime) | `from` | `2026-06-01T09:00` |
| To (datetime) | `to` | `2026-06-29T17:30` |
| Page | `page` | `2` |

(`from`/`to` use the HTML `datetime-local` format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`.)

**Detail view.** Click a row to open `GET /admin/logs/:id` — full request headers, the matched WAF
rule (if any), the block reason/stage, status, and the resolved country/ASN.

<div style={{margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/docs_logs_detail.png"
    alt="Log detail view showing timestamp, app/service, host, real client IP vs proxy/CDN IP, country, query string, user agent, request ID, ASN, ISP/organisation, and TLS connection details"
    style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '1px solid #e2e5ea'}}
  />
</div>

**Export.** The **Export** button hits `GET /admin/logs/export` with the *same* filter query params
and downloads a CSV of the matching rows — so you can export exactly what you've filtered to.

**Retention.** Logs are pruned by the separate `prune` command / systemd timer, not from this page
(see [Log Retention & Pruning](/docs/configuration/log-retention)).

**Routes:** `GET /logs`, `GET /logs/stream` (SSE), `GET /logs/:id`, `GET /logs/export`.

## Settings

**Page:** `/admin/settings` · **Purpose:** admin account, security subsystems, and integrations.

<div style={{margin: '1.5rem 0'}}>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/docs_settings.png"
    alt="Settings page showing the Account section with current email, new email, new password, and confirm password fields, plus the Database backup download button"
    style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '1px solid #e2e5ea'}}
  />
</div>

**Change admin credentials.** Enter your **current password**, then a **new email** and/or **new
password** (typed twice). Submitting (`POST /admin/settings/credentials` with `current_password`,
`new_email`, `new_password`, `confirm_password`) re-hashes the password with bcrypt and invalidates
old sessions. Do this immediately if you started from the dev fallback (`admin@localhost` /
`admin123`).

**Bot protection.** Toggle the global challenger and tune it (`POST /admin/settings/bot` with
`bot_enabled=1`, `bot_threshold`, `bot_ttl`):

- **Enabled** — turn the JS proof-of-work challenge on/off globally.
- **Threshold** — the anomaly score above which a client is challenged.
- **TTL** — how long a solved bypass cookie stays valid (seconds).

Per-service overrides (`inherit`/`always`/`off`) are set from each service's Manage panel. See
[Bot Protection](/docs/security/bot-and-fingerprinting).

**Rate limiting backend.** Choose the backend and (for Redis) its connection
(`POST /admin/settings/ratelimit` with `rl_backend` = `memory`/`redis`, `rl_redis_addr`,
`rl_redis_password`). Use **Test connection** (`POST /admin/settings/ratelimit/test`) to verify
Redis reachability **before** saving. Switching backends is a hot reload. See
[Rate Limiting](/docs/configuration/rate-limiting).

**ACME email.** Set the Let's Encrypt contact email (`POST /admin/settings/acme-email` with
`email`). This must be set before per-service auto-issue or global ACME will work.

**Webhooks.** Configure event delivery (`POST /admin/settings/webhook` with `webhook_url`,
`webhook_secret`, `webhook_enabled=1`, and one or more `webhook_events` checkboxes). If no events
are selected it defaults to `blocked`. Delivery is asynchronous and signed with the secret; a slow
endpoint never blocks logging. See [Threat Intel & Webhooks](/docs/security/threat-intel-webhooks).

**Threat-intel sources.** On **Threat Intel** (`/admin/threat-intel`): add a source with a **label**,
a **URL** to a plain-text IP/CIDR list, and a sync **interval (hours)** (`POST /admin/threat-intel`).
Each row can be **toggled** on/off (`POST /admin/threat-intel/:id/toggle`), **synced now**
(`POST /admin/threat-intel/:id/sync`), or **deleted** (`DELETE /admin/threat-intel/:id`). Synced IPs
flow into the IP blocklist automatically.

**Database backup.** `GET /admin/settings/backup` downloads a copy of the entire `waf.db`. Treat the
download as sensitive — it contains the bcrypt admin hash and challenge secret. Store it securely.

## Dashboard home, notifications & metrics

- **Home** (`/admin`) shows live traffic and threat charts (`/admin/api/traffic`,
  `/admin/api/threats`) and an at-a-glance summary.
- **Notifications** stream in over SSE (`/admin/api/notifications/stream`); mark them seen with the
  bell control.
- **Metrics** at `/admin/metrics` serve Prometheus exposition format (same admin auth). See
  [Metrics](/docs/configuration/metrics).
