# Troubleshooting

**Dashboard shows a certificate warning.** Expected with a self-signed cert — add a browser
exception, or configure a domain + ACME from **Settings → TLS** to get a trusted Let's Encrypt cert.
See [TLS Setup](/docs/configuration/tls).

**ACME certificate isn't issued.** Ensure DNS for your domain points at the server, that ports 80
and 443 are reachable from the internet, and that you started the binary with both `--listen :80`
(for the HTTP-01 challenge) and `--listen-tls :443`.

**All clients share one IP / rate limiting blocks everyone.** You're likely behind a proxy or load
balancer but haven't set `--trusted-proxies`, so the real client IP isn't being read from
`X-Forwarded-For`. Add the proxy's CIDR to `--trusted-proxies`. Conversely, if you set
`--trusted-proxies` too broadly while directly internet-facing, clients could spoof their IP — only
list CIDRs you actually trust. See [Trusted Proxy & Real Client IP](/docs/security/trusted-proxy).

**WAF detects but doesn't block.** Make sure you're on a normal build (blocking is enabled after the
CRS includes by design). Check whether the specific rule was disabled from the dashboard. See
[WAF Inspection](/docs/security/waf).

**A backend can't be added.** The add wizard probes the backend first; if it's unreachable from the
WAF host, the save is rejected. Verify the backend URL and network path.

**Service won't start under systemd.** `sudo journalctl -u coraza-waf-mod -e` for the error. Common
causes: port already in use, missing `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` (binding 80/443), or a bad `--db`/`--certs`
path the service user can't write.

**Logs growing too large.** Confirm the prune timer is active (`systemctl list-timers | grep coraza`)
or add a cron job calling `coraza-waf-mod prune`. See [Log Retention & Pruning](/docs/configuration/log-retention).
